        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="about-me"> Hello, my name is Parth Bakhda. I was born in India raised in Arizona. Some of my interest include skiing,
          hiking, going to the gym, and binge watching tv shows.
          As a young child I had two full-time working-class parents, so I had to learn everything on my own, that did
          not
          stop me for achieving. In 5th grade I was in a commercial for the diary Counsil or my outstanding attendance
          and
          grades.
          I like learning new skills thus, my reason for joining this coding bootcamp. I find it invigorating to apply
          what I have learned into creating beautiful works of art thru coding.
          My goal is to succeed in this course and after find a career where I can grow internally and become
          financially
          stable. I have experiences and projects which I have listed in this portfolio,
          it will give you an idea of how I became the person I am today.
