# <Professional Portfolio>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? My Motivation was to build a presentable and working website that showed my strengths and talents.
- Why did you build this project? I built this project to challenge myself and understand how to utilize different elements and how to incorporate them. 
- What problem does it solve? Problem it solves is it displays a working and stable portfolio to show who I am as a person.
- What did you learn? I learned different HTML and CSS styling elements and how to use them but also learned how use flex boxes and wireframes.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. First I had to write the code from scratch, building HTML and elements to get them to apply properly, then I had to build the CSS and make sure the styling elements were working hand in hand to the HTML. Then I had to write the readme file and fill it out.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
